== Guide for users

If you have been told to get pullacces to jbdevstudio repositories create a pull-request against this repository, 
adding your username to the teams you should be part of.

Most just needs to be added to pullonly.team to be able to clone the project.

== Special teams

. link::[Owners.team] - those that can adjust everything on a team including billing information.
. link::[pullonly.team] - users in here can pull from all repositories.

== Repository teams

Each repository has one team which can both pull & push to the same repository with same name as the team.

. link::[jbdevstudio-ci.team] 
. link::[jbdevstudio-qe.team]
. link::[jbdevstudio-artwork.team]
. link::[jbdevstudio-website.team]
. link::[jbdevstudio-devdoc.team]
. link::[jbdevstudio-product.team]

== Guide for how to setup/update users

The link::[syncmember.sh] is what does the magic.
You need to be a owner of the repositories to run these successfully.

   $ export GITHUB_USER=<githubusername>
   $ export GITHUB_PWD=<githubpwd>
   $ <do changes/checkout pullrequest for the .team files>
   $ sh ./addmembers.sh
   
This will use the github API to check all users are present and add those not found. 

It will *not* remove users, but it will print out a warning about users already added that was not in the .team file.
If such user is found and he need to be removed use github website to remove the user.

During the run `syncmember.sh` will sort the .team files and this will cause a diff if the pullrequest did not add its users alphabetically - 
this is just fine and an expected diff which is simplest just to commit so the ordering stays consistent.
